# Reading notes

This repo is just here for me to practice testing with Pytest as I go throught the [Python testing with pytest](https://pragprog.com/book/bopytest/python-testing-with-pytest) book by Brian Okken. Personnal code will be available in the various folders, main takeaways in this readme.

Also a good occasion for me to practice correct formating, docstrings etc as I transition from working on small-medium scale data analytics projects running in Jupyter Notebooks to a more public setting where documentation and readability must prevail.

## Chapter 1 : Getting started with pytest

So far, nothing new.

Need to get better at virtual environments.
